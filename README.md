# `MACHINE LEARNING BOOTCAMP`:
### Hey there, 
- #### I've made a Machine Learning project during 7 days Bootcamp, conducted by <b> DEVTOWN </b>. 
The instructor during the session was Mr. Shaurya Sinha (Data Analyst Intern at Jio). I got to 
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with DEVTOWN.
